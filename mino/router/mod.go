	// represents the destination as the key, and the packet to send as the
	// value. The simplest forward would be, if the destination is A,B,C, to
	// create a map with 3 entries:
	//
	//  {A: packet{to: [A]}, B: packet{to: [B]}, C: packet{to: [C]}}.

	// For a tree routing, the first message will send a packet with all the
	// recipients to the root address (A in the following), like:
	//
	//	{A: packet{to: [A, B, C]}}

	// The second return of the function contains the list of addresses that are
	// known the be broken.
